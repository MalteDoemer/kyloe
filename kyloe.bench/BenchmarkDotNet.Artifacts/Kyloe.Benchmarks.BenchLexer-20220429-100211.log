// Validating benchmarks:
Benchmark BenchLexer.LexSimple returns a deferred execution result (IEnumerable<SyntaxTerminal>). You need to either change the method declaration to return a materialized result or consume it on your own. You can use .Consume() extension method to do that.
Assembly kyloe.bench which defines benchmarks references non-optimized kyloe
	If you own this dependency, please, build it in RELEASE.
	If you don't, you can disable this policy by using 'config.WithOptions(ConfigOptions.DisableOptimizationsValidator)'.
Assembly kyloe.bench which defines benchmarks is non-optimized
Benchmark was built without optimization enabled (most probably a DEBUG configuration). Please, build it in RELEASE.
If you want to debug the benchmarks, please see https://benchmarkdotnet.org/articles/guides/troubleshooting.html#debugging-benchmarks.
